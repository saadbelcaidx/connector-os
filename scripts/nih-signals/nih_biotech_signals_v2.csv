In healthy cells; these proteins are efficiently degraded by the proteasome system; which maintains cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis). However; in ND; the accumulation of IDPs in oligomeric states a

Recent evidence indicates that soluble oligomeric Aβ42 (oAβ42) begins accumulating in the human brain one to two decades before clinical symptoms of AD emerge. Multiple studies suggest that elevated levels of soluble oAβ42; rather than insoluble Aβ plaques; drive the selective degeneration of vulnerable neur

The entorhinal cortex (EC) is one of the most vulnerable brain regions during the early stage of AD. Neurons in the EC; particularly the fast-spiking; parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic neurons; are vulnerable to degeneration in AD. The loss of PV neurons strongly correlates with AD pathology and cognitive impairment. However; the molecular mechanisms unde

STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,ANNE  BRUNET,,1468868,2026-01-15,2030-11-30,The brain as a control center for other organs during aging,R01,2026,Fresh funding — scaling up,A,SUMMARY The goal of this multi-investigator proposal is to determine how the brain can act as ‘neural pacemaker’ to regulate the tempo of aging of the whole organism. Aging is a multifaceted process that alters the function of every organ and is associated with devastating diseases. An inherent limitation to understand and target aging has been the ability to perform systems level studies to identify central drivers of organismal aging. All vertebrate studies have remained limited because of the

The bidirectional relationship between MetS and periodontitis exacerbates both conditions; but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Cognition is considered to be an emergent brain function resulting from neural network level computation rather than individual cellular processing; but exactly how AD cognitive impairment results from progressive disconnection of hippocampal networks due to cellular level neurodegeneration is unclear.

In non-fibrotic livers; the hepatocytes are accessible from the systemic blood circulation due to the fenestration of hepatic sinusoids. For this reason; most liver-directed gene therapy today is administered systemically; typically by intravenous injection. However; the systemic route of administration has several disadvantages. First; every organ is exposed to the gene thera

The entorhinal cortex (EC) is one of the most vulnerable brain regions during the early stage of AD.

The loss of PV neurons strongly correlates with AD pathology and cognitive impairment. However; the molecular mechanisms unde

Consequently, Quadcept Inc. will renew its payment system on April 1, 2026, to further enhance its security measures.\n\nWith this renewal, the license purchase functionality currently available in 'Quadcept Manager' will be migrated to the new 'Quadcept Store'. Furthermore, due to technical constraints following the system overhaul, Quadcept Inc. regret to inform you that Quadcept Inc. will be discontinuing its current \"Loyalty Discount\" and \"Volume Discount\" programs.\n\nIn their place, Quadcept Inc. is introducing a new structure where discounts are applied based on the subscription period you select at the time of purchase. Quadcept Inc. has set these new discount rates to remain at a similar level to the previous system, ensuring that you can continue to enjoy its services at a great value.\n\nPlease note that the new discount structure will apply to all new and renewal license contracts once the transition to the 'Quadcept Store' is complete. Quadcept Inc. apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your kind understanding and cooperation.\n\nKey Changes.\n\n* Migration to the New Payment System, 'Quadcept Store' - * Payment functionality currently managed within 'Quadcept Manager' will be exclusively provided through the new system, 'Quadcept Store'.\n\n* Changes to the Discount Structure - * The current \"Loyalty Discount\" and \"Volume Discount\" will be discontinued.\n* Moving forward, a new discount structure will be introduced based on the subscription period selected at the time of purchase.\n\n* Enhanced Security (3D Secure 2.0) - * Quadcept Inc. is replacing the conventional password authentication (3D Secure 1.0) with an advanced security measure that instantly analyzes over 80 risk parameters, including customer device information and purchase history. This highly accurate system is designed to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions, such as credit card theft.\n* Simple identity verification (e.g., one-time password) by the card issuer will only be requested when the transaction is deemed to carry a high risk of fraudulent activity.\n* By integrating its payment processing with Stripe, which adheres to the global security standard PCI DSS, Quadcept Inc. ensure a highly secure payment service. This includes multi-layered defenses such as data encryption via SSL/TLS, AI-powered fraud prevention systems, and multi-factor authentication.\n\nQuadcept cart system (Store) renewal schedule.\n\n* Renewal Date: - * Wed., Apr 1st, 2026\n\nScheduled Maintenance:Tue., Mar 31st, 2026, 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM (JST)\n\n* If you wish to make a purchase using the current system, please complete your transaction by 6:00 PM on Tue., Mar 31st, 2026. Once the maintenance is finished, all purchases will be processed through the new \"Quadcept Store\".\n\nDetails regarding Discount Structure Changes.\n\nAbolition of existing discounts.\n\nThe current discount programs will be discontinued:\n\n| Volume Discount | A discount determined by the total number of licenses (newly purchased plus existing licenses) at the time of contract. |\n| Loyalty Discount | A discount based on the cumulative continuous contract period for licenses renewed for one year or more. |\n\nIntroduction of new Discount Structure.\n\n* Subscription Period Discount - Under the new discount structure, Quadcept Inc. will introduce the \"Subscription Period Discount\", where the discount rate is determined by the \"contract period\" at the time of purchase. Please refer to the table below for the specific discount rates.\n\n| / | 1 Month | 1 Year | 3 Years |\n| Discount rate | 0% | 5% | 5% |\n\n* Distribution of Discount Coupons - In addition to the \"Subscription Period Discount\", it is possible to further increase the discount rate by applying coupons. Coupon discount rates will vary depending on the details of specific campaigns and events. Quadcept Inc. plan to distribute coupons from time to time following exhibitions or seminars. Details will be provided on this website and via email, so please be sure to check them.\n\nAction required / important notes for customers.\n\nRequest for Credit Card re-registration.\n\nCredit card information currently registered in the system will not be transferred upon migration to the 'Quadcept Store'. Quadcept Inc. sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, but customers who wish to pay by credit card are asked to re-register their card details when placing their first order after the 'Quadcept Store' launch.\n\nModification of Credit Card sharing settings.\n\nThe current functionality that allows individual users within a team to set up their own credit card will be discontinued after the migration to the 'Quadcept Store'.\nGoing forward, credit card settings will be tied to the Team Information (i.e., the entire team entity). This change means that the credit card information sharing setting will be limited to \"Shared within the Team\". Please be advised that individual user-level setting and sharing will no longer be possible.\n\nNecessary procedures for automatic renewal.\n\nFor customers paying by Credit Card.\n\nCustomers currently using automatic renewal via credit card payment will have their stored card information deleted. Consequently, the automatic renewal process will not execute after the migration to the 'Quadcept Store'. Quadcept Inc. request that you register your credit card and manually proceed with the license renewal within the 'Quadcept Store'. Once you manually renew and switch the automatic renewal setting to ON, subsequent updates will be processed automatically.\n\nFor customers paying by Bank Transfer.\n\nCustomers currently using automatic renewal via bank transfer will have their automatic renewal settings carried over to the 'Quadcept Store'. No action is required from you.\n\nFor license purchases via trading companies or partners.\n\nShould you purchase Quadcept licenses through a trading company or partner, please direct your request for a quotation regarding the renewed pricing to the respective company or partner.\n\nOther notices.\n\nDiscontinuation of the \"1 Month free\" Benefit for annual contracts.\n\nCurrently, when a 1-year license contract period is specified, one month is provided free of charge. However, in conjunction with the migration to the 'Quadcept Store' and to simplify its pricing structure, this benefit will be discontinued.\n\nChange in contract duration options.\n\nCurrently, the contract period for license purchases can be specified within the range of \"1 month to 12 months\". Considering recent trends in its customers' contract preferences, Quadcept Inc. has decided to review the scope of designated contract periods.\nAfter the migration to the 'Quadcept Store,' you will be able to contract for one of the following terms: \"1 Month\", \"1 Year\", or \"3 Years\".\nNote: For customers who prefer a duration such as \"3 months\", continued use similar to the conventional method is still possible by manually or automatically renewing the \"1 Month\" contract three times.\n\nPayment methods.\n\nThe payment methods remain the same.\nYou can continue to pay via \"Prepayment: Credit Card\" or \"Post-payment: Bank Transfer\".\n\nAdvance issuance of quotations under the New discount system.\n\nPrices and quotes based on the new discount structure can be confirmed using the Quote Simulation tool. Your personalized coupon code is provided in the related newsletter, with the discount rate adjusted for each individual customer. By applying the coupon, you can check the estimated amount with the discount applied.\n\n* Please note that the coupon discount applies only to customers who have received a coupon code.\n\nWithin your Quadcept account, only users with Owner or Administrator privileges can generate quotes while logged in. Since other user roles do not have permission to obtain quotes, please contact your account owner or administrator for assistance.\nPlease note that the same coupon code is distributed to all users, regardless of their permission level.\n\nThis coupon is a sample coupon that can only be applied to the Quote Simulation tool. Official coupons applicable after the migration to the 'Quadcept Store' are scheduled to be sent separately on April 1, 2026. Since the discount rate is the same as the current sample coupon, there will be no change to the quoted amount. Please rest assured.\n\nSecurity of 'Quadcept Store'\n\nThe 'Quadcept Store' utilizes the payment platform Stripe, and its security adheres to Stripe's standards, ensuring you can use its services with confidence.\n\nQuadcept Inc. is committed to providing enhanced services so that you can continue using Quadcept with confidence.
